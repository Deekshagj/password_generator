# PyPassword Generator

## Description

This is a Python script that generates a random password based on user preferences for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers to include. It offers two levels of complexity: easy and hard.

- **Easy Level**: In this mode, the password is generated as a string concatenation of randomly selected characters from the provided sets of letters, symbols, and numbers.

- **Hard Level**: Here, the password is created as a list first, to allow shuffling of characters for added security.
